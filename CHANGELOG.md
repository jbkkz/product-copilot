# Changelog

All notable changes to Product Copilot are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-31

A hardening-and-proof milestone: the reasoning was validated end to end on real, messy input, the
robustness holes that real input exposes were closed, and the regression lens and docs were finished.

### Added
- A second worked example, `examples/event-checkin-reconciliation/` — a rambling, multi-feature client
  email taken end to end (request → model → assessment → epic → acceptance criteria). The assessment
  refuses the "tie this together" conflation, catches a disguised-employment (*salariat déguisé*)
  exposure the request never mentions, and sequences the two builds against a fixed deadline.
- `golden_diff.py --questions` now prints each challenge's `alternative` and `recommendation`, not just
  the headline — the half of a challenge that separates an architect's pushback from a bare observation.
- Complete `--brief` assessment baselines across all six golden request forms (previously only two), so
  the challenge block can be measured on every problem shape before it is tuned.

### Fixed
- `pc discover` no longer crashes on a real-length request. `Path.exists()` raises above the OS filename
  limit, so any request longer than a tidy sentence — i.e. any real client email — died before reaching
  the engine.
- `pc discover ""` (empty or whitespace request) now fails fast with a usage message instead of crashing
  on `Path("")` resolving to the current directory.

### Changed
- The engine's `system` prompt (prompt + schema + all context cards) is sent as a single
  `cache_control: ephemeral` block, so its prefix is cached across the calls of a session — the K runs of
  a golden capture, the up-to-eight turns of `converse()`, and each JSON retry — cutting repeated-call
  input cost to roughly a tenth.

## [0.4.0] - impact calibration + the dependency DAG

### Added
- `core/dependencies.py` — the dependency DAG made explicit: `propagate()` (blast radius of a change),
  `diff_models()` (material change between two model versions), and `stale_on_disk()`.
- `pc impact` — an offline query for the decisions to re-validate and artifacts to regenerate when a slot
  changes; `pc answer` now runs the diff each turn and warns which generated files no longer match.
- A release-notes generator (`pc release`).

### Changed
- Impact calibration: `impact_default` is a baseline, not a ceiling — a compliance/audit/traceability
  need named anywhere in the request escalates the relevant slots to high impact.

## [0.3.0]

- Repository cleanup: removed the demo GIF cluster and the redundant `requirements.txt` in favour of the
  `pyproject.toml` single source of truth.

## [0.2.0]

- README polish and structure per review feedback.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial public release: the requirements engine and discovery loop, the solution assessment (the
  differentiator — a judgment that contests the request's premises, not a recap), the artifact
  generators (PRD, user stories, estimate, acceptance criteria, delivery epic with GitHub/GitLab
  exports), and the MIT license.
