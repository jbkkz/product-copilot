`supertool` is a declared dependency of this plugin and installs alongside it, so this rule ships
unconditionally rather than behind a presence check frontmatter has no way to express -- a tree
that carries this layer already carries `supertool`.

There is no read, edit, write, glob or grep that cannot go through it. Use the op that replaces
the call just refused:

- **Read** -- `supertool 'read:PATH'`
- **Edit** -- `supertool 'edit:@-'` (a TOML payload on stdin) or `supertool 'edit:::OLD:::NEW:::PATH'`
- **Write** -- `supertool 'paste:@-'` (a TOML payload on stdin, fields `path` and `content`) or
  `supertool 'paste:::PATH:::CONTENT'` -- `paste` creates missing parent directories and rewrites an
  existing file, so it covers both halves of a Write
- **Glob** -- `supertool 'glob:PATTERN'`
- **Grep** -- `supertool 'grep:PATTERN:PATH'`

No exception for an image, a PDF or a notebook cell: none exists in this repository today. If one
appears, that is when it gets one -- not before.
